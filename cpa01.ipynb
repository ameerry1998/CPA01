    "## Through this analysis we've found some interesting results which seem to comply with reality. In the first plot we can see the value of all Importing/Explorting of all goods and services. As we can see in plot 1 there's a significant drop around march of 2020 which hold strong until around february 2021. However today there seems to be a significant almost full recovery. Looking at the pivot table plotwe can see that the demand for good far outweighs the demand for services, and through time the demand for good is increasing while the demand for services is decreasing. \n"
